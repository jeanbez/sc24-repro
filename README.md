# SC24 Guidelines for SCC

This document is based on the AD/AE report generated by authors. 
Here, we compile a list of frequently asked questions concerning the AD/AD Appendices.

## Stick to the Template

- Ensure the subsequent **two lines are commented out** prior to submitting the appendix! Ensure all text is in black; remove any blue text.
  ```latex
  %\usetag{explanation}
  %\usetag{example}
  ```

- Use the provided LaTeX template!

- Do not alter the template, i.e., do not add author names, affiliations, etc.

- Do not misuse the AD/AE Appendices to include additional information apart from the artifacts.

## Do I need to a (Zenodo) DOI in the AD Appendix?

In general, the AD Appendix should contain an artifact that is publishable. Hence, you need to create a public DOI with the artifact(s).
